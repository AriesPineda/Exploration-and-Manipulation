# Exploration-and-Manipulation

## Basic Data Exploration and Data Manipulation Project

This small project defines a command-line tool for interactive exploration and cleaning of CSV data using the pandas library. The read_csv_file function prompts the user to input a CSV file's path or name, reads it into a pandas DataFrame, and presents a menu for data exploration, cleaning, saving, or exiting the program. Exploration options include displaying data shape, head, tail, data types, and checking for null or duplicated values. Cleaning options cover removing missing values, replacing values, dropping columns, and changing data types. The script also allows saving the modified DataFrame back to a new CSV file. The tool enhances user interactivity by providing a step-by-step interface for data manipulation and analysis.
